<b> NWIT101 Minecraft Pi Team Project</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>PORJECT PROPOSAL</b>
<br>
<br>
<b> Team Members </b>
<ul>
	<li> Jan Guiao
	<li> Dennis Ho
	<li> Eden Fuango
</ul>
<b> Project Responsibilities </b>
<ul>
	<li> Jan Guiao: Journal, Proposal, Abstract, Website, Reports, Presentation/Lead Investigator
	<li> Dennis Ho: Journal, Proposal, Abstract, Website, Reports, Presentation/Webmaster
	<li> Eden Fuango: Journal, Proposal, Abstract, Website, Reports, Presentation/Logistics Coordinator
</ul>
<b> Project Description </b>
<p> We will be exploring the virtual world of Minecraft Pi. We will introduce a first-time setup on how to install Minecraft Pi formerly and learning how to control the player, manually build with blocks and use the Python interface to make up the world (Using Python 3).We will also make our Minecraft Pi and tutorials available on the Internet. 
<br>
<b> Why this is an IoT project </b>
<p> This project can represent IoT because we are applying knowledge throughout game physics by using programming and code to create a working functionality in game with a Raspberry Pi 
that will be connected through the Internet.
<b> Plan/expect to learn </b>
<p> We will be able to recognize programming methods through Python 3 and learn along the way how it affects our methods and decision making. In summary we plan/expect to learn 
<ul>
	<li>	Python 3 programming
	<li>	Python 3 libraries
	<li>	Raspberry Pi
	<li>	Minecraft Pi
	<li>	IoT setup (i.e. making the Raspberry Pi containing Minecraft Pi available online)
	<li>	How to work as a team
</ul>
<ul>
